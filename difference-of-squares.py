# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#   1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 9^2 + 10^2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#   (1 + 2 + ... + 9 + 10)^2 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
# first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
#   3025 - 385 = 2640
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# one hundred natural numbers (1 - 100) and the square of the sum.
